SAGA Training
-------------

Discussion regarding the tutorial structure - October 13, 2010.

(10 min) Shantenu Jha: Intro - 10 min. max. (SAGA projects discussion will be at
         the end of the tutorial).

(30 min) Andre Merzky will talk about the API via conference phone. Will talk
         about the structure, calls, look & feel, explain everything per API
         packages.  This will take at least 30 minutes. Don't talk about the
         motivation. If it cannot be done remotely, Shantenu or Ole will take
         over.

(30 min) Ole Weidner will talk about deployment. SAGA will be preinstalled on
         Cyder - 15 min. Since people attending the tutorial will be TG sys
         admins, and users, Ole should present few slides on how to use SAGA on
         TG machines. - 15 min.

(30-40 min) Hartmut Kaiser will talk at least 30 minutes introducing  all
         3 interfaces: Python, command line tools, C++. Instead of programming
         exercises, he will talk about them (~5 mins each), give a table of
         correspondence between the 3 of them, like copying a file and
         submitting a job, and show how/that it works. The most accessible is
         the command line tools. He will show a couple of examples that people
         can try out, compile and run at a later time (after the tutorial). He
         will tell them how to try it out, walk them through, and show them
         what to expect. If failure, they can get in touch with us. (Another
         idea was to give attendees the opportunity to try it out and report
         error and log messages via a back channel, like a chat.)

(10 min) Shantenu will close the tutorial with a10 min description of  SAGA
         projects.
